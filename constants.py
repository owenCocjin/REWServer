## Description:  Uses a dict named "GLOBE" to manage constants
## Notes:
##    - GLOBE is a dict used for globals that may change across all files
##    - You can include normal globals as their own variables, but don't change them!
## Update Notes:
GLOBE={
"ADDR":"0.0.0.0",
"PORT":8080,
"ROOT":"HTML"
}
