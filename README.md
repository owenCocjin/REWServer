## Installing
__!__ This repo contains a submodule! Make sure when you clone you use `--recursive` __!__

> If you forgot to use 	--recursive	, you can update the submodule with `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Running
This repo requires files from my other project: [ProgMenu](https://github.com/owenCocjin/ProgMenu)
This allows use of command line args. The required files are already included with this repo, but if for any reason you need help with it now you know where to go!
